# About
Hello and welcome, I am Johnny and I am the Lead Consulting Engineer(Data Science, Machine Learning) in [Allied Telesis](https://www.allied-telesis.co.jp). 
I started my Data Science and Machine Learning journey in 2018, at that time the knowledges was pieces by pieces and sometimes I really forgot what I have learned, 
and some "ah-ha" monents will escaped from the finger tips if I didn't record it down. 
So I started this blog, mainly for consolidate the knowledges and skills, it do have much benefits: 

* It’s like a resume, only better. I know of a few people who have had blog posts lead to job offers!
* Helps me learn. Organizing knowledge always helps me synthesize my own ideas. One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else. A blog post is a great way to do that.
* Saves time. Any time you answer a question multiple times through email, you should turn it into a blog post, which makes it easier for you to share the next time someone asks.
